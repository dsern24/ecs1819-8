                            The Energy Guardians team is a group that I was a part of throughout my 8th grade year of school. We were chosen by our science teachers in order to help our school reduce the amount of energy used and to teach the community about energy use.

                    <h3 id="list1"> As a team, we split our whole school up into different teams and created a competition in which the team who used the least amount of energy throughout a span of 2 weeks would win. We did this by entering the classrooms, noting specific appliances and measuring how much energy they used (with a kill-a-watt measurer). Then, we would return each day at different times and note whether or not those appliances were plugged in or not. At the end of two weeks, we summed up the results and the winning classroom received dress down passes and treats.

                    <h3 id="list1">
                        As a whole 8th grade, we did energy related projects like energy efficent homes which were mini versions of homes we designed in teams with energy conserving items such as double paned windows, or extra insulation. Once done, we organized the "Energy Fair" in which all of our projects were displayed. Then, the Energy Guardians created 'stations' to teach students and parents about energy in different ways. Our team decided to do magnetic slime, in which the students made their own slime and were then able to play with magnets and observe how their slime moved toward it. Other teams did things like energy jenga and battery power.
